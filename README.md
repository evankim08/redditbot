# redditbot

For this project, I used Python and the PRAW API to create multiple Reddit bots. These bots were programmed to post comments supporting Arnold Schwarzenegger as a politician, primarily as a light-hearted joke. 



## Favorite Thread

My favorite [thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r2egby/steve_bannon_and_reince_priebus_push_audit_of/hm4l3at/) including my bot was very short, and included an interaction with another bot that converted the units in my comment:

I liked this interaction because at a basic level, it shows how different bots can take elements of comments generated by other bots in order to continue a conversation somewhat logically. In a way, it reminded me of real-life conversation, where humans often take a part of someone's statement and use it to drive or redirect the conversation. Also, it was entertaining to imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger, one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time, lifting 200 pounds of colorful pizza blankets.

## Output

Below are the outputs from running `bot_counter.py` for each of my bots:

**Extra Credit #4 :** Below is the output of running `submissionbot.py`. This bot created new submission posts instead of just new comments. These submissions were pulled from _r/Showerthoughts_ and _r/LifeProTips_ and posted into the class subreddit _r/BotTown2_. By the final iteration, the bot had generated 278 unique submissions, some of which were self-posts and some of which were URL posts, as desired. 

```
Self-Post Count = 142
URL Post Count = 136
```

**Extra Credit #5 :** As seen above, I have created an army of 5+ reddit bots, each posting similar comments with different `praw.ini` files. Each bot posted 500+ valid comments, as desired.


**Extra Credit #6 :** Below is the output of running the final iteration of `topcommentbot.py` . This bot replies to the most highly upvoted comment that it hasn't already replied to, without ever replying to itself. 

```
Top Comment Reply Count = 134
```

**Extra Credit #7 :** Below is the output from running the final iteration of my `upvotebot.py` program, which used _TextBlob Sentiment Analysis_ to upvote any comment or submission that mentioned _Arnold_ or _Schwarzenegger_ with positive sentiment, and downvoted those with negative sentiment. Since there were not many submissions that mentioned Arnold Schwarzenegger, I also wrote the program so that it downvoted any mention of either _Trump_ or _Biden_, as this funnels publicity away from Arnold. By the final iteration of the program, there were 500+ comments and 100+ submissions upvoted or downvoted, as desired. 

```
Current Comment Upvote Count = 8277
Current Comment Downvote Count = 22753
Current Submission Upvote Count = 0
Current Submission Downvote Count = 135
```
